    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Ready to make the best cornbread dressing of your life? You're in luck! This old-fashioned dressing recipe will quickly become a family favorite.</p>
    <p>Be careful not to bake the dressing too long, as this will dry it out. Bake it just until it's golden brown around the edges.</p>

        <li>3 cups crumbled cornbread</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>

        <li>½ cup chopped celery</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>2 cups chicken stock</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried sage, or more to taste</li>
