## **THE PROJECT**

This is a basic recipe website done as part of [the Odin Project's Foundations Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations).

It currently contains:

 - An extremely simple homepage [`index.html`](https://github.com/NotMeksi/odin-recipes/blob/f9577702c05f50127dde7a48c2113078aac1bb12/index.html)
 - A page for a Basic Mashed Potato recipe [`basic-mashed-potato.html`](https://github.com/NotMeksi/odin-recipes/blob/f9577702c05f50127dde7a48c2113078aac1bb12/recipes/basic-mashed-potatoes.html)
 - A page for a Green Bean Casserole recipe [`green-bean-casserole.html`](https://github.com/NotMeksi/odin-recipes/blob/f9577702c05f50127dde7a48c2113078aac1bb12/recipes/green-bean-casserole.html)
 - A page for a Cornbread Dressing recipe [`cornbread-dressing.html`](https://github.com/NotMeksi/odin-recipes/blob/f9577702c05f50127dde7a48c2113078aac1bb12/recipes/cornbread-dressing.html)

The deployed site can be viewed [here.](https://notmeksi.github.io/odin-recipes/)



**CONCEPTS IMPLEMENTED**
This project is currently coded completely in HTML.
From what I learnt on the Odin Project, I practiced:

- Working with a standard HTML boilerplate.
- Using anchor tags `<a></a>` complete with attributes such as `href`.
- Using ordered and unordered lists (`<ol></ol>` & `<ul></ul>`) and `<li></li>` list item tags.
- Using image tags `<img>` with `src`, `alt` and `width` attributes.
- Working with relative links.
- Using various heading tags e.g `<h1>` and `<h2>` as well as paragraph tags `<p>`.
- Working with the terminal.
- Using Git and GitHub for version history management for my project.
- And more beginner level coding skills here and there.

It was a fun little project üëçüèº
